Advantage of Garbage Collection
o	It makes java memory efficient because garbage collector removes the unreferenced objects from heap memory.
o	It is automatically done by the garbage collector(a part of JVM) so we don't need to make extra efforts.

finalize() method
The finalize() method is invoked each time before the object is garbage collected. This method can be used to perform cleanup processing. This method is defined in Object class as:     protected void finalize(){}  

Note: Garbage collection is performed by a daemon thread called Garbage Collector(GC). 
      This thread calls the finalize() method before object is garbage collected.
